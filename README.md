# Minecraft Paradise
We present you the brand new modpack Project Paradise from "Team Paradise". It's a quest based modpack with many new and exciting mods you have to use.

## Our Team

We are a team of several people. We have myself @Toscanphoenix and two others able to help or answer general question in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/uBTH2W2). One of us will try to respond in a timely manner.

### Getting Started
For our modpack you need at least one Program:
 * [Twitch Launcher](https://www.twitch.tv/downloads)
 
Additionally we recommend a Texture Pack because we have had problems with the Blood Altar and Chiseled Blood Runes. A fix will come as soon as possible

### Installing
Download the modpack Project Paradise and start launching it. Have fun and show us your best work on Twitter via @ParadiseTeam2

## Development

 PLEASE NOTE FOLLOWING:

```
- We are working on more quests as soon as possible to make it easier to get into each mod. Our problems are on the give-take side because      we are often not sure which rewards we should distribute.
- Not all Quests have a Reward. [fixed] 
- Not all Quest trees (Outside the main Questline) are completed.
- A Biome O`Plenty world generation is at this moment not possible (Game-Crash) [fixed] 
- Blood Altar- Chiseled Blood Runes are missing textures.
