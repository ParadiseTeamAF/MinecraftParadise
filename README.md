## Development

 PLEASE NOTE FOLLOWING:

```
- We are working on more quests as soon as possible to make it easier to get into each mod. Our problems are on the give-take side because      we are often not sure which rewards we should distribute.
- Not all Quests have a Reward. [fixed] 
- Not all Quest trees (Outside the main Questline) are completed.
- A Biome O`Plenty world generation is at this moment not possible (Game-Crash) [fixed] 
- Blood Altar- Chiseled Blood Runes are missing textures.
